# PyStartup

This is a example of some basic info that you would need in every python tool/script. The idea is to copy paste some parts of the code in order to speed up the development. In the future this could be some kind of script that could auto generate code given some options.

But firsts, let's complete the example with some typical snippets:

 ```py
    # TODO: Way to read and write in a file
    # TODO: Exception
    # TODO: Dataframes
 ```

## Use

 ```sh
python3 main.py --required_arg bla --bool_option y
 ```

 And please, improve the name....
